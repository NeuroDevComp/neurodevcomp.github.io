I am a cognitive scientist specializing in language acquisition and comparative cognition. I serve as a Principal Investigator at the Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu and I lead the NeuroDevComp group. My research explores the types of cognitive mechanisms serving the early stages of language learning in humans. To tackle this problem, I take a comparative perspective, investigating how newborns and infants as well as other animals detect linguistic structures from the speech signal.

I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Padova (Italy) in 2016, with a specialization in animal cognition. After completing my doctorate studies, I did a post-doctoral training at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (USA) focusing on infant language learning. I then joined the Center for Brain and Cognition at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain) as post-doctoral fellow where I mainly worked on the acquisition of syntax and syllabic structures, categorization processes and preferences for speech in infants, and learning of linguistic constraints in rats. 

In 2024, I was awarded an ERC Starting Grant (European Union) for my project Gates to Language (GALA), which aims at investigating the origins of neural and cognitive mechanisms at the onset of language learning, testing humans at different developmental stages (0 to 10 month old), rats as animal model, and different sensory inputs (linguistic, auditory non-linguistic, and vibro-tactile).

I am a post-doctoral researcher investigating **language acquisition** and **how young minds make sense of the world**. My work focuses on developmental psychology and psycholinguistics, studying how humans process language at different stages in development: from **newborns** to **infants**, **toddlers**, and **adults**. Under the GALA project, I investigate how neonates, infants, and non-human animals process different syllabic structures, searching for common mechanisms supporting language processing. To do this, I use a combination of **eye-tracking**, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (**fNIRS**), and **computational modelling**. with a special focus on **computational reproducibility**. **Bayesian statistics** are a big part of how I try to make sense of data.

In 2024 I obtained my Ph.D. at the Center for Brain and Cognition, **Universitat Pompeu Fabra**, supervised by Prof. Núria Sebastian-Galles. I earned my B. Sc. in Psychology from the **Universidad de Oviedo** in 2013, and my M. Sc. in Neurosciences at the **Universitat de Barcelona** in 2018.

I am a **Ph.D. student** at **Universitat Pompeu Fabra** in Barcelona, enrolled in the Ph.D. Program in Biomedicine. I am interested in the **early acquisition and processing of language** by infants, using different techniques such as **behavioral** ones, **eye-tracking** and **fNIRS**.

I obtained my **M. Sc. in Integrative Biology and Physiology**, specialized in Behavioral Neurosciences in **La Sorbonne Université** and spent a year working as a research engineer on the early acquisition of language in the **INCC**--Language & Cognition team in Paris. I am currently involved in the GALA project investigating **how babies, at only a few months old, perceive syllables**.

I work as research assistant for the GALA project. I facilitate research by aiding **data collection**, providing **logistic and administrative support**, and taking care of the call center to **invite families to participate** in our studies. I obtained my M. Sc. in **International Experimental and Clinical Linguistics** at the **University of Potsdam** (Potsdam, Germany), and my **BA in Psychology** at **Bethany College** (Kansas, USA). I am very interested in research aiming to understand **language acquisition mechanisms** and strategies, with a special focus on **understudied populations, languages, and dialects**.
