What mechanisms support this readiness for language learning early in life? This is one of the main research questions at the NeuroDevComp group, which we address by studying newborns a few hours after birth.\nWe use a technique called fNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) that allows to measure newborns’ spontaneous neural activity when listening to auditory inputs (e.g., continuous speech, individual syllables and words). We are currently conducting these studies at the Sant Joan de Deu Barcelona Children Hospital."

Young infants are known to pick up rules and structures of their native language(s) very quickly and effortlessly.\nSpecifically, we are interested in how infants segment the speech into small units like syllables. To tackle this issue, we use different techniques:\n\nBehavioral: we measure how long infants look at a computer screen while listening to different types of speech sounds\nEye-tracker: we track infants’ gaze movements on the screen with high precision, and also measure their pupil dilation when listening to speech sounds\nfNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy): we are interested in looking at the activation of different brain areas when infants are listening to speech sounds"

    "text": "I am a cognitive scientist specializing in language acquisition and comparative cognition. I serve as a Principal Investigator at the Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu and I lead the NeuroDevComp group. My research explores the types of cognitive mechanisms serving the early stages of language learning in humans. To tackle this problem, I take a comparative perspective, investigating how newborns and infants as well as other animals detect linguistic structures from the speech signal.\nI earned my Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Padova (Italy) in 2016, with a specialization in animal cognition. After completing my doctorate studies, I did a post-doctoral training at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (USA) focusing on infant language learning. I then joined the Center for Brain and Cognition at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain) as post-doctoral fellow where I mainly worked on the acquisition of syntax and syllabic structures, categorization processes and preferences for speech in infants, and learning of linguistic constraints in rats.\nIn 2024, I was awarded an ERC Starting Grant (European Union) for my project Gates to Language (GALA), which aims at investigating the origins of neural and cognitive mechanisms at the onset of language learning, testing humans at different developmental stages (0 to 10 month old), rats as animal model, and different sensory inputs (linguistic, auditory non-linguistic, and vibro-tactile)."

My work focuses on developmental psychology and psycholinguistics, studying how humans process language at different stages in development: from newborns to infants, toddlers, and adults. Under the GALA project, I investigate how neonates, infants, and non-human animals process different syllabic structures, searching for common mechanisms supporting language processing. To do this, I use a combination of eye-tracking, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and computational modelling. with a special focus on computational reproducibility. Bayesian statistics are a big part of how I try to make sense of data.\nIn 2024 I obtained my Ph.D. at the Center for Brain and Cognition, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, supervised by Prof. Núria Sebastian-Galles. I earned my B. Sc. in Psychology from the Universidad de Oviedo in 2013, and my M. Sc. in Neurosciences at the Universitat de Barcelona in 2018."
